# PAS-19668

Welcome to the PAS 19668 Github.

Blockchain has created the infrastructure for an open financial system, offering ‘out-of-the-box’ native transparency and compatibility of transactions. As we build assets and securities on top of blockchains, or in other words, applications, those applications need to retain the transparency and interoperability elements to prevent the ‘siloing’ of the stack built on top of blockchains. This is where standards come in to ensure that the principles of openness and interoperability remain true with applications built on blockchains. The BSI PAS 19668 project is one of many standards aiming to keep the blockchain industry coordinated as they seek to develop new applications on top of differing blockchain systems and to ensure cross-chain compatibility between those applications. For PAS 19668 the primary focus is the use of blockchain to develop digital securities or Security Tokens and in so doing ensuring that the formatting and content of the data associated with those assets remains standardised. The PAS is a coordinated effort with some of the established players in the Security Token industry and thought leaders over the course of a few years. 

The PAS specification is public. We have replicated the specification below. You are free to add a suggestion to the specification and additional data fields that you wish to add. All additional data fields are provided on an MIT License. If the new data fields become widely used then a formal update will be suggested to the PAS based on the adoption of those new data fields.
